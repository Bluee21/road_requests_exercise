I like how the site caters to people with disability with the read to me function available on the home pages. While reviewing some of the video interviews i found the the interviewer Mr Mosnier voice is too low at least compared to the interviewee. i had to put in earbubs to hear the question he was asking.

### Json Format
In this format we see when collapsed to results we have 25 lines that all expand and shows the the first 25 items of the collection. In each expansion we have attributes on the item. JSON also shows that is collection's index is [112]


### Command-Line
the command-line view is basically a code and content all together with no formatting making it hard to read and understand.

From an enduser point of view the normal webpage view is the easy view to access the content of the collection. For developers the json format give you more useful information on the item to allow you to manipulate the data.
